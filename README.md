# CitiBikeNYC

The objective was to play with the largest bike sharing program in the United States [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike).

The expectation was to generate regular reports and dashboards for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

Information of three months of 2020 was downloaded from [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. The data was cleaned and appended into one file using Pandas.

The final report and dashboard has been uploaded in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ana.cifuentes#!/vizhome/CityBikeNYC_15959861668270/2020CityBikeNYCStory?publish=yes).
